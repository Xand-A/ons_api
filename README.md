# Import data from ONS using Python

The UK's Office of National Statistics (ONS) publishes comprehensive data about the economy, population and society at national, regional and local levels. 

The ONS also have an API which makes a large portion of the data avaliable for direct querying instead of having to download data

This repo has a small example of how to access the API using python, compared to the Javascript examples on the API documentation
